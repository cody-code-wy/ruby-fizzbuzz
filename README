Several implementations of FizzBuzz in ruby with different methods, and lots of commets to help understand whats happening (some of these are overly complex)

If I am drawing directly form the ideas of anyther person I will mention them!

The non-alphanumeric ones are just for fun, its not a good way to actually program. Just a fun practice!
